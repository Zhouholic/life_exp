# Abstract

Here, I re-examine the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

# Analysis

```{r,message=False}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)

gapminder_unfiltered %>%
  group_by(year ) %>%
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(country, year, lifeExp) %>%
  arrange(year) -> sumdf
sumdf
```

making plot
```{r }
library(ggplot2 )

sumdf %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x= year, y=lifeExp ), color = country)+
  geom_point( )+
  theme_bw()
```

Exercise: Calculate the average life expectancy (averaging over countries) in 2000. Add this to life_exp_analysis.Rmd. Commit your changes

```{r }
gapminder_unfiltered %>%
  filter(year == 2000) %>%
  summarise(average_le = mean(lifeExp))
```
